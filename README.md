## Contents
Here are 24 Xmas themed coding challenges which begin with very simple challenges and finish with some where more advanced algorithms have to be coded to solve the tasks.  

Along with [a class with 24 empty methods](https://github.com/xnafan/YuleCoding/blob/master/YuleCoding.Code/YuleMachine.cs), which you need to fill with merry holiday code, there is [a suite of unit tests](https://github.com/xnafan/YuleCoding/tree/master/YuleCoding.Tests), which have to pass in order for the exercises to have been completed and [a complete set of suggested solutions](https://github.com/xnafan/YuleCoding/blob/master/YuleCoding.Code/YuleMachineSolved.cs) for the tasks.  

There is a [Word document](https://github.com/xnafan/YuleCoding/blob/master/The%20YuleMachine.docx) in the repository which contains further description, hints and guidelines.

### Note
The exercises are using the 24th of december (Christmas Eve) as the big day in the Christmas season, as I am from Denmark. You can adapt this to the 25th of December (Christmas Day) if that's what you're used to 😊

### 🎅🎁🎄 Have fun, and Merry Christmas / Happy Holidays! 🎅🎁🎄

Kind regards - Jakob Farian Krarup
